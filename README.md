 AI-Powered Disease Prediction System

🚀 Machine Learning for Early Diagnosis of Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, and Diabetes

📌 Project Overview

This project leverages Machine Learning & Data Science to predict the likelihood of three critical diseases:
✔️ Heart Disease – Uses diagnostic data to predict cardiovascular risk.
✔️ Parkinson’s Disease – Analyzes biomedical voice measurements to detect Parkinson’s.
✔️ Diabetes – Predicts diabetes onset using clinical diagnostic metrics.

By integrating feature selection, model training, and real-time predictions, this system enhances early diagnosis and supports healthcare decision-making.
